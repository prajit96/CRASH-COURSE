1. Callback Approach:

>>Create a Node.js script that reads data from multiple files asynchronously using callbacks.
>>Aggregate the data and perform operations on it.
>>Ensure proper error handling using callback functions.

2. Promise Approach:

>>Refactor the script using promises to handle asynchronous operations.
>>Use fs.promises to read files asynchronously and handle aggregation with .then() and .catch().

3. Async/Await Refactor:

>>Further refactor the script using async/await to make the code more readable and synchronous-looking.
>>Use fs.promises with async functions and try/catch blocks for error handling.
